Introduction
------------

The goal of py-amqplib-rpm is to provide a working RPM for RHEL 5.x+ based
linux distributions.

If patches for source for other distributions are submitted, they must first
continue to work under anaconda and yum before they will be accepted.

INCLUDED:
- py-amqplib 0.6.1 from http://code.google.com/p/py-amqplib
- This RPM is unsigned.  To sign it, please use 'rpm --addsign'.
